### SUMMARY:

The doodle recognizer project uses neural networks and a massive dataset of over 50 million doodle image data contributed by over 15 million players to recognize the doodle drawn by the user. It prompts the user to draw a doodle from a category, such as "car", "banana", "apple", "door", etc. It uses the users' drawn doodle and performs pattern recognition to identify the closest doodle that fits in the same category. The vision problem that is being targeted in this project is pattern recognition.
