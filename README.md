### SUMMARY:

The doodle recognizer project uses neural networks and a massive dataset of over 50 million doodle image data contributed by over 15 million players to recognize the doodle drawn by the user. It prompts the user to draw a doodle from a category, such as "car", "banana", "apple", "door", etc. It uses the users' drawn doodle and performs pattern recognition to identify the closest doodle that fits in the same category. The vision problem that is being targeted in this project is pattern recognition.

### BACKGROUND:
The inspiration for this project comes directly from Google’s “Quick, Draw!” application. It is a web application where the users are prompt to draw doodles for six randomly chosen categories. The application analysis each doodle drawn by the user and uses neural networks to closely identify the doodle’s category. The neural networks are trained using a dataset of 50 million drawings collected by over 15 million players. The quickdraw dataset is publicly available to develop custom image recognition algorithm or to simply analyse the data. 

For our project, we decided to use pattern recognition and the massive collection of Google’s quickdraw dataset to closely identify the users’ drawn doodle to a doodle under the same category. The project will further generate metrics to how closely the two doodles relate with each other. Along with the metrics, it will also identify if the users’ doodle matches the category. 

For example, a user will be asked to draw a doodle of an apple. It will extract the data and compare it to the collection of horse doodles in the dataset. The figure 1 below is a visual representation of the horse doodles in the dataset. It will pick the horse doodle that closely relates to the user’s doodle version. The application will process, analyse the doodle, and declare if the doodle matches the description of a horse based on the dataset.
